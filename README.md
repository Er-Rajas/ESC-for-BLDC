# ESC for BLDC Motor

Welcome to the ESC for BLDC Motor project repository! This open-source project is dedicated to creating an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) specifically designed for Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motors.

## Project Overview

In this project, we've harnessed the power of technology to build a versatile and efficient ESC for controlling BLDC motors. The heart of the ESC is an Arduino Nano, which forms the brain that interprets your commands and controls the motor.

## Key Features

- **Arduino Nano**: The ESC is powered by an Arduino Nano, making it easy to program and customize.
- **Eagle for Circuit Design**: We've used Eagle, a widely recognized PCB design tool, to meticulously craft the circuitry for this ESC.
- **Fusion 360 for 3D Modeling**: For those interested in the mechanical aspects, our Fusion 360 files are available, allowing you to explore and customize the physical design.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: This repository includes everything you need to replicate or modify the ESC. You'll find schematics, PCB layouts, component lists, and Fusion 360 files in the appropriate folders.
